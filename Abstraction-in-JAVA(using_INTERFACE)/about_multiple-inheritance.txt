Confusing multiple interfaces as Multiple inheritance:-- 


Some people (and textbooks) have said that allowing classes to implement multiple interfaces is the same thing as multiple inheritance

This is NOT true.  When you implement an interface:
The implementing class does not inherit instance variables
The implementing class does not inherit methods (none are defined)
The Implementing class does not inherit associations

Implementation of interfaces is not inheritance.  An interface defines a list of methods which must be implemented.
